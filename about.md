### Currently

I am currently attending the Nashville Software School.  I'm in Cohort 7, and currently learning front end development.

### Before

I have degrees in Finance and Economics.  I worked in Finance in California, mainly in start-up enviroments.  We tried to save the pension plans of some very large corporations in a pretty unique way.  We got surprisingly close...before the crash.  I was also in charge of capital investments and fundraising at a middle Tennessee based start-up before deciding to switch to tech.

More details about my previous work experience can be found on [my LinkedIn.](www.linkedin.com/pub/leon-peck/4/969/a1/)
