      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <h3>Currently</h3>
      <p>I am currently attending the Nashville Software School.  I'm in Cohort 7, and currently learning front end development (so far that means HTML, CSS and some Javascript).</p>
      <h3>Before</h3>
      <p>I have degrees in Finance and Economics.  I worked in Finance in California, mainly in start-up enviroments.  We tried to save the pension plans of some very large corporations in a pretty unique way.  We got surprisingly close...before the crash.  I was also in charge of capital investments and fundraising at a middle Tennessee based start-up before deciding to switch to tech.</p>
